create a class called Employee that includes three pieces of information as fields—a first name (type
String), a last name (type String) and a monthly salary (type double). Your class should have a constructor that
initializes the fields. Provide a getter setter properties for each field. If the monthly
salary is not positive, set it to 0.0. Create an overridable method named giveRaise(). Override the ToSTring() method
from object class appropriately here. Write a test application named EmployeeTest
that demonstrates class Employee’s capabilities. Create two Employee objects and display the yearly salary for each
Employee. Then give each Employee a 10% raise and display each Employee’s yearly salary again.

Create a class Permanent employee that is derived from employee class and it includes extra fields HRA (hoursing rent allowance), DA (dearness allowance)
and Provident Fund. Choose the field types appropriately and also create read only properites for each of these fields.
Create  fields named Joining Date and Expected Retirement Date. Also create properties for both the fields.
Ensure to create constructors and appropriate methods (atleast two). Override the giveRaise() method from parent class and
ensure that now along with %raise in salary, the hra and da are added and the final salary is appropriately calculated.
Override the ToString() method appropriately for a permanant employee object.
